This project is not in the TechNet article.

The idea is to show how to export a DataTable to a MS-Access MDB which was read in from a MS-Excel WorkSheet.

Since in this case all Excel columns are known there is no need for a user interface to map fields nor is there
code to permit selective columns to export where a reboust solution would allow the user to select all or some columns.

Excel columns are read in without column names, there should be logic to allow sheets with names to be read.
